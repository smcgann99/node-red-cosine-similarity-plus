# @smcgann/node-red-cosine-similarity-plus

A <a href="http://nodered.org" target="_blank">Node-RED</a> node that calculates the cosine similarity, between a set of stored vectors and provided vector values. 

This node is a significantly modified version of üîó [@good-i-deer/node-red-contrib-cosine-similarity](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@good-i-deer/node-red-contrib-cosine-similarity) and doesn't maintain compatibility with that node.

---

## **Key Changes**

‚úî **input data** - accepts payload direct from üîó [@smcgann/node-red-face-vectorization-plus](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@smcgann/node-red-face-vectorization-plus).   
‚úî Supports multiple stored vector locations: file, flow context, or global context.   
‚úî Stored vectors now also include names and image file data, for meaningful results.       
‚úî Returns sorted results, filtered by a configurable similarity threshold.       
‚úî Generates an error message if no results meet threshold.         
‚úî More robust error handling with validation for missing and invalid data structures.    
‚úî Supports runtime configuration through `msg.cosineOptions` for dynamic settings.     
‚úî Includes metadata in `msg.cosineConfig` (threshold used, file type, file path).     
‚úî **Easier integration** into Node-RED flows.

## **Description**

This node calculates cosine similarity between two sets of vectors. One passed in by `msg.payload` and one stored in a file or context variable.
It returns the results in `msg.payload`as an array of objects, where the similarity is above set threshold.

```javascript
input = array[2] // (2 faces)

0: array[0.12, 0.34, 0.56, "..."] // 512 vectors for each face.
1: array[0.11, 0.22, 0.33, "..."]

// Stored as a nested object, with each key representing an individual person.
storedVectors = 
{
  "Adam": {
    "/full-path/Adam/Adam-01.jpg": [0.12, 0.34, 0.56, "..."], // 512 vectors for each face.
    "/full-path/Adam/Adam-03.jpg": [0.23, 0.45, 0.67, "..."],
    "/full-path/Adam/Adam-02.jpg": [0.34, 0.56, 0.78, "..."]
  },
  "Alison": {
    "/full-path/Alison/Alison-01.jpg": [0.11, 0.22, 0.33, "..."],
    "/full-path/Alison/Alison-02.jpg": [0.44, 0.55, 0.66, "..."]
  }
  // repeated for x number of people

}

output = array[2] // (2 matches above threshold)
[
    { "Alison": { "/full-path/Alison/8.jpg": 0.7265643591861766 } },
    { "Peter": { "/full-path/people/Peter/9.jpg": 0.6443388973714721 } }
]
```

## **Installation**

Either use the Edit Menu - Manage Palette option to install, or run the following command in your Node-RED user directory - typically `~/.node-red`

```bash
cd ~/.node-red
npm install @smcgann/node-red-cosine-similarity-plus
```

Restart your Node-RED instance

## **Input Properties**

### üìå **msg.payload** ‚Üí `Array`  

- The input is an array of vector arrays. (created by the vectorize node)
  
### ‚öôÔ∏è **msg.cosineOptions** ‚Üí `Object` *(Optional)*  
- Allows overriding node config settings dynamically.  
- Example:  
``` json
{  
  "threshold": 0.4,  
  "fileType":"path",
  "file":"/home/pi/vectortest.txt" 
}  
```

### üè∑Ô∏è **Name**

- The name of the node displayed on the screen.

### üéöÔ∏è **Threshold**

- Results with a value equal to or above the specified threshold will be returned. Set the threshold to 0 to include all matches.

### üìÇ **Vectors**

- File or context path of file or variable, that will be compared with the input vector array. Cannot be empty.

## **Output**

### üìå **msg.payload** ‚Üí `Array`  

- The output is an array of name objects. Each containing the orginal source image file and percentage similarity to the input vectors.
  
### ‚öôÔ∏è **msg.cosineConfig** ‚Üí `Object` 
- The configuration used for the calculations.
